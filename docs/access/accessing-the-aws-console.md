# Accessing the AWS Console

Sometimes there's no substitute for the AWS Console. When you have lots of AWS accounts, getting into the AWS Console in the right account can be a challenge. Substrate's here to help.

Visit [https://example.com/accounts](https://example.com/accounts) (substituting your Intranet DNS domain name) to see a listing of all your AWS accounts with links to open the AWS Console.

In your terminal, you can use the `--console` option to any normal invocation of `substrate assume-role` to open the AWS Console in your browser right from there.
